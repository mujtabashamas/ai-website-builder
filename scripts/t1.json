I will create a landing page for a Web3 domain service provider.

**1. Project Structure & File Organization:**
*   `app/page.tsx`: The main entry point that assembles the different sections of the landing page.
*   `app/layout.tsx`: Root layout, will import a modern font (Inter) and set up the base HTML structure with dark mode support.
*   `app/globals.css`: Tailwind CSS directives and custom global styles, including definitions for gradients and dark theme variables.
*   `components/Header.tsx`: A sticky navigation header with a logo, nav links, and a "Connect Wallet" button. It will need to be a client component (`'use client'`) to handle the mobile menu state.
*   `components/HeroSection.tsx`: The main "above the fold" content. It will feature a catchy headline, a sub-headline, and a prominent domain search bar. I'll use a dynamic background with subtle animations.
*   `components/FeaturesSection.tsx`: A section to showcase the key selling points of the service. I'll use a grid of cards, each with an icon from `lucide-react`, a title, and a description.
*   `components/PricingSection.tsx`: A section with pricing tiers presented in cards. One plan will be highlighted as the "Most Popular".
*   `components/TestimonialsSection.tsx`: A social proof section with quotes from users. This will be laid out in a clean grid.
*   `components/CTASection.tsx`: A final, strong call-to-action before the footer.
*   `components/Footer.tsx`: A standard footer with links, social media icons, and copyright information.
*   `components/ui/button.tsx` and `components/ui/card.tsx`: Reusable, styled primitive components to ensure UI consistency, following shadcn/ui patterns.
*   `lib/utils.ts`: Contains the `cn` utility function for merging Tailwind CSS classes.
*   `package.json`: To define project dependencies.
*   `tailwind.config.ts`: To configure Tailwind CSS, including custom colors, animations, and the dark mode strategy.

**2. Styling and Design:**
*   **Theme:** I'll use a dark, tech-focused theme by default, which is common in the Web3 space. The color palette will consist of a dark charcoal background, with vibrant accents of electric purple and blue for interactive elements and highlights.
*   **Typography:** I'll use the 'Inter' font from Google Fonts for its clean and modern look. I'll establish a clear typographic hierarchy.
*   **Visuals:** `lucide-react` will provide sleek, minimalist icons. I'll create a subtle, animated gradient background for the hero section to make it feel dynamic and futuristic. Glassmorphism (blurred backgrounds) will be used for the header to make it float above the content.
*   **Interactivity:** All interactive elements like buttons and links will have distinct hover and focus states with smooth transitions. I'll add subtle entrance animations to the sections or cards to make the page feel more alive as the user scrolls.
*   **Responsiveness:** The layout will be fully responsive using a mobile-first approach. Flexbox and CSS Grid will be used to ensure the layout adapts gracefully from small mobile screens to large desktop monitors. The header will feature a hamburger menu on mobile.

**3. Frameworks and Libraries:**
*   **Framework:** Next.js 14 with the App Router.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
*   **Icons:** `lucide-react`.
*   **Utilities:** `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` for the `cn` function, and `tailwindcss-animate`.

**4. Accessibility:**
*   Use semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
*   Ensure interactive elements are keyboard-navigable.
*   Use `aria-label` for icon-only buttons.
*   Use sufficient color contrast.
*   Use `sr-only` class for screen-reader-only text where appropriate.

**5. Implementation Steps:**
1.  Define `package.json` with all necessary dependencies.
2.  Configure `tailwind.config.ts` with the dark theme, custom colors, and animations.
3.  Set up the root `layout.tsx` with the font and base structure.
4.  Create the reusable UI primitives: `button.tsx` and `card.tsx`.
5.  Build each section as a separate component, from `Header.tsx` to `Footer.tsx`.
6.  Make the `Header.tsx` a client component to manage the state for the mobile menu.
7.  Compose the final page in `app/page.tsx` by importing and arranging the section components.
8.  Add comments to the code to explain complex parts.
9.  Final check for responsiveness and accessibility.
